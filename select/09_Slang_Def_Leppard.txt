(Slang!)

Sittin' dark getting taken 'cause I said
Something lewd in a low down accent (Yeah yeah yeah)
Kinda love those eyes
I wanna get down
But I ain't your guy

I'll rap and ruck and jam it up
But count me out
'Cause all I ever wanna get is slang
(All right)

Slang with me
(I don't wanna get my hands dirty)
Slang with me
(I just wanna get soakin' wet)
Slang with me
(I don't wanna get my hands dirty)
All I ever wanna get is slang

What's affectin' my condition
What's about to knock you down
Said wrapped and bound and a goddamn
I'd love to get connected
But it's outta my hands

I'll rap and ruck and jam it up
But count me out
'Cause all I ever wanna get is slang
(All right)

Slang with me
(I don't wanna get my hands dirty)
Slang with me
(I just wanna get soakin' wet)
Slang with me
(I don't wanna get my hands dirty)
All I ever wanna get is slang

It's my intention to be your obsession
It's my obsession to be your addiction
(Uno! Dos! Tre! Cuatro!)

Slang with me
(I don't wanna get my hands dirty)
Slang with me
(I just wanna get soakin' wet)
Slang with me
(I don't wanna get my hands dirty)
All I ever wanna get is

Slang with me
(I don't wanna get my hands dirty)
Slang with me
(I just wanna get soakin' wet)
Slang with me
(I don't wanna get my hands dirty)
All I ever wanna get is slang
