[00:17.56] Let me put it this way, doll
[00:37.59] I know it's getting late
[00:41.67] I can tell from the planes of your face
[00:45.99] That you're from out of state
[00:49.84] But here in the Willows, now, here's the deal
[00:53.80] Tomorrow's for squares, and tonight's for real
[01:16.80] 
[01:01.01] Drop me off in groove time
[01:05.09] Do you hear the slang of ages?
[01:09.41] Show me how it's done
[01:19.91] 
[01:15.52] Now, did you say you were from the Netherlands
[01:19.20] Or was that "nether world"?
[01:23.83] If you grew up in Amsterdam
[01:27.55] Well, then I'm the Duke of Earl
[01:31.70] These tabs look iffy, but you say they're good
[01:35.92] Let's roll with the homeys and knock on wood
[01:57.92] 
[01:42.72] Drop me off in groove time
[01:46.75] Soothe me with the slang of ages
[01:50.72] Show me where I turn
[02:00.72] 
[02:20.56] You are part of the dreaming
[02:24.00] The end of my life so far
[02:28.09] Or something halfway in between
[02:31.85] You ought to know
[02:34.08] Where'd you go?
[02:36.19] Where'd you go?
[02:43.69] 
[02:38.45] Damn, she skipped dimensions
[02:42.64] Was it something that I said?
[02:46.64] Or something I was thinking
[02:50.64] When she opened up my head?
[02:54.94] Let me make it right, babe, never mind how
[02:58.98] There's a crazy little place I know called "Be There Now"
[03:27.48] 
[03:05.94] Drop me off in groove time
[03:09.91] Do you hear the slang of ages?
[03:14.07] Show me how it's done
[03:18.72] Drop me off in groove time
[03:22.72] Soothe me with the slang of ages
[03:26.94] This is where I turn
[03:36.94] 
[03:31.06] That's right
[03:34.47] Slang me
