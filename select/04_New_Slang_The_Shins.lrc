[00:37.98] Gold teeth and a curse for this town
[00:42.73] Were all in my mouth
[00:45.36] Only I don't know how
[00:48.60] They got out, dear
[00:50.97] Turn me back into the pet
[00:54.28] I was when we met
[00:57.41] I was happier then
[00:59.97] With no mindset
[01:07.47] 
[01:01.80] And if you took to me like
[01:08.25] A gull takes to the wind
[01:11.84] Well I'd've jumped from my trees
[01:15.85] And I'd've danced like the king of the eyesores
[01:19.57] And the rest of our lives would've fared well
[01:42.07] 
[01:23.17] New slang when you notice the stripes
[01:28.54] The dirt in your fries
[01:31.87] Hope it's right when you die
[01:34.67] Old and bony
[01:37.18] Dawn breaks like a bull through the hall
[01:40.43] Never should have called
[01:43.33] But my head's to the wall
[01:46.08] And I'm lonely
[01:53.08] 
[01:48.36] And if you took to me
[01:53.12] Like a gull takes to the wind
[01:57.07] Well I'd've jumped from my trees
[02:01.92] And I'd've danced like the king of the eyesores
[02:05.46] And the rest of our lives would've fared well
[02:27.96] 
[02:28.10] Godspeed all the bakers at dawn
[02:32.17] May they all cut their thumbs
[02:35.83] And bleed into their buns
[02:37.97] 'Til they melt away
[02:40.66] I'm looking in on the good life
[02:46.11] I might be doomed never to find
[02:48.89] Without a trust, a flaming field
[02:53.23] Am I too dumb to refine?
[03:05.23] 
[02:56.72] And if you took to me like
[03:00.57] Well, I'd've danced like the queen of the eyesores
[03:04.72] And the rest of our lives would've fared well
